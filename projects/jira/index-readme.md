Perfect choice! 🐛🛠️ An **Issue/Bug Tracker** (like Jira) is **perfect** for testing your NestJS + Mongoose skills — it's realistic, has lots of features, and demonstrates your ability to model complex relationships and workflows.

Let’s break it down into manageable chunks:

---

## 🔧 Project: **Issue/Bug Tracker API**

### 🧱 Core Entities (Mongoose Models)

#### 1. **User**

```ts
- _id
- name
- email
- password (hashed)
- role: ['admin', 'member']
```

#### 2. **Project**

```ts
- _id
- name
- description
- members: [UserId]
- createdBy: UserId
- createdAt
```

#### 3. **Issue**

```ts
- _id
- title
- description
- type: ['bug', 'task', 'feature']
- status: ['open', 'in_progress', 'review', 'closed']
- priority: ['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical']
- reporter: UserId
- assignees: [UserId]
- project: ProjectId
- createdAt
- updatedAt
- attachments: [File or URL]
```

#### 4. **Comment**

```ts
- _id
- issueId: IssueId
- author: UserId
- message
- createdAt
```

#### 5. **ActivityLog**

```ts
- _id
- issueId
- action: string (e.g. "status changed from 'open' to 'in_progress'")
- user: UserId
- timestamp
```

## ✅ Suggested Milestones (Build in Steps)

### 🥚 MVP 1 – Users & Projects

* Auth (register/login)
* Create/get/update projects
* Add users to a project

### 🐣 MVP 2 – Issues

* Create, assign, change status/type/priority
* List and filter issues per project
* Basic activity logging

### 🐥 MVP 3 – Comments

* Add/view comments on issues
* Link to users

### 🐓 MVP 4 – Advanced Features

* Attachments
* Notifications (optional)
* Swagger API docs
* Unit & e2e testing with Jest

## 💡 Bonus Ideas (To Go Pro)

* Real-time updates with WebSockets (e.g., issue status change)
* Email notifications (e.g., when assigned to an issue)
* Drag-and-drop kanban layout (for front-end)
* Integration with GitHub issues or Slack (just for fun)
